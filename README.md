## My process

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [TMDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was my first experience with Next.js so I learned a lot of things such as:
- Working with Next.js API routes
- Dynamic routes
- Different rendering methods such as Server-side rendering and Static site generation
- [useSWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) which I plan on expanding the use of for future pagination
- Figuring out Next.js Image component 

### Continued development

I still don't feel super confident with rendering methods and using Next.js API routes so I would love to continue building projects with Next.js and getting used to it.

Also in the future I plan on adding search by genre, and pagination for the search results, because right now it only displays one page.

### Useful resources

- [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) - The docs are always the best place to start when learning anything new, it was a tremendous help.
- [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - I'm still relatively new to Tailwind so referring back to the docs for styling classes was a constant need.
- [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) - This is a course I bought some time ago, and it has a Next.js section that helped with some examples of how pages, dynamic routes, and API routes worked in Next.js.
